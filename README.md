# Scheduled Lists

## Checklist loader

This is a nuxt/vue/tailwind project that loads a checklist from a JSON file. The goal of the project is for the checklist to eventually automate itself on a schedule set by a user. Currently, this is not implemented. In its current state, the checklist is a test JSON file that contains meeting rooms in my workplace. The submit button sends and formats an email to me through a netlify function.

Eventually, there will be user accounts, so that users can customize their own tasks, and schedule them for themselves. The past checklists will be submitted to a database, and there will be email notifications for scheduled tasks.
